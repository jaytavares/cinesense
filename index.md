# Cinesense: an Audio Sensing Add-on for Bose Cinemate Speakers

## Overview

Do you have Bose Cinemate speakers? Do you wish they would just turn on automatically when you need them
and turn off when you're done? Well, now they can!

This project only works with Bose Cinemate **Series II** speakers. Since the Cinemate Series I speakers don't have an optical audio input, the Cinesense will not work with them.
