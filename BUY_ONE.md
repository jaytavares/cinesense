# Buy a Cinesense Adapter

Unfortunately, due to microchip shortages, I have stopped taking orders for adapters. If you would like to be notified when they become available again, [click here to join the waiting list](https://forms.gle/aZ4epW23LM2YaGUw5).

## Cost
### Shipping to the United States
Total cost of a Cinesense adapter shipped to you is $55.

### Shipping to other countries
Typically, shipping fees to most other countries will add $15 to $20 to the price.
