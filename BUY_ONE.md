# Buy a Cinesense Adapter

~~Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 related microchip shortages, I have stopped taking orders for adapters. If you would like to be notified when they become available again, [click here to join the waiting list](https://forms.gle/aZ4epW23LM2YaGUw5).~~

I've secured a small number of microchips! The housing I use for the adapter is backordered until the end of May, but I'm still taking orders for delivery in June. The price is $55 and includes shipping/handling to any US-based address.

**Please note that adapters ordered now won't ship until June.**
