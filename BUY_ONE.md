# Buy a Cinesense Adapter

~~Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 related microchip shortages, I have stopped taking orders for adapters. If you would like to be notified when they become available again, [click here to join the waiting list](https://forms.gle/aZ4epW23LM2YaGUw5).~~

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ I've secured a small number of microchips! As such, I can take orders for adapters again. The price is $55 and includes shipping/handling to any US-based address. [Order here while supplies last!](https://www.paypal.com/instantcommerce/checkout/253NYFSKX75HA) ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

### International shipping
